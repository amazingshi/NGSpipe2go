Obtained from the `yeastRNASeq` Bioconductor [package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/yeastRNASeq.html)
The subset of the data which this package contains is more specifically
data from a wild-type and a single mutant yeast. For each condition (mutant,
wild-type) there is two lanes worth of data, each lane containing a sample of
500,000 raw (unaligned) reads from each of 2 lanes each. 

```{r}
if(!require(yeastRNASeq)) {
  BiocManager::install("yeastRNASeq")
  require(yeastRNASeq)
}

files <-  list.files(file.path(system.file(package = "yeastRNASeq"), "reads"), full.names=TRUE)
files.fastq.gz <- files[grepl("\\.fastq\\.gz$", files)]
dir.create("./rawdata", showWarnings=FALSE)
sapply(files.fastq.gz, file.copy, to="./rawdata/")
```
