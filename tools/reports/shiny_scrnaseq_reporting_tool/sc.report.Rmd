# Quality control on bulk RNA

## FastQC of all reads 

The raw sequence reads of all samples are analysed with the popular FastQC tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

1. The "Read qualities" Box-Whisker plots show the range of quality values across all base positions:
    (i) The central red line is the median value,
    (ii) The yellow box represents the inter-quartile range (25-75%),
    (iii) The upper and lower whiskers represent the 10% and 90% points,
    (iv) The blue line represents the mean quality.
The y-axis on the graph shows the Phred quality scores, which are logarithmically related to the base-calling error probabilities. The higher the score the better the base call. The background of the graph divides the y axis into very good quality calls (green), calls of reasonable quality (orange), and calls of poor quality (red). Typically, the majority of calls on all base positions fall into the green area.

2. The "Sequence bias" plots show the proportion of each base (% G, A, T and C) at each position. In a random library there would be little difference between the positions of a sequence run, so the lines in this plot should run parallel with each other. But most RNA-seq libraries show sequence imbalance in the first 10-12 read positions due to RT priming biases, which should however look fairly similar in all samples.

3. The "GC Content" plots show the GC% distribution of all reads (red lines) and the ideal normal distribution based on the data (blue lines). Typically, the red and blue lines tightly overlap and look essentially the same in all samples. An unusually shaped distribution could indicate a contaminated library.

```{r FastQC_paragraph1, echo=F, results='asis', error=F, warning=F, message=F}
##### parameters to set:
# Select samples for which you would like to include fastqc results in the report. For single cell RNA-Seq with many cells, 
# you may want to restrict the total number of plots. If you provide a regular expression in 'samplePattern' only those

# files containing read1 of a read pair. This is recommended e.g. for MARS-Seq, where Read2 contains barcode information only.
# For samplePattern=NULL (default) all fastq files will be included.
# If you want to exclude samples according to the given certain pattern (instead of including), set exclude=T. 
# This is e.g. for excluding the trimmed fastq files which contain "cutadapt" in the file name (see below). 
# If you set argument 'maxno', the maximum sample number will be restricted accordingly to the first 'maxno' plots.

## Gene body coverage ##

The plots below show meta-gene profiles of 5' to 3' read coverage and can reveal biases due to RNA degradation or specific library prep protocol; polyA-selection protocols are particularly prone of producing 3' coverage bias upon RNA degradation. The grey line depicts the actual read coverage and the red line shows the overall trend.

## Competetive mapping to rRNAs and other contaminats:

A competitive mapping to the reference genome and known rRNAs (H.sapiens, M.musculus, C.elegans, D.melanogaster, D.rerio, X.tropicalis) as well as frequently occuring Mycoplasma species (M. arginini, M. fermentans, M. hominis, M. hyorhinis,M. orale, and Acholeplasma laidlawii), E.coli and Bos taurus was performed with FastQScreen (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastq_screen/).

In the following plot the "one_genome" label refers to the amount of reads mapping to that genome only regardlessly if they are multi mapping or uniquely mapping reads.
The "multiple_genome" label refers to the amount of read mapping to this genome but also to other genomes in the screening regardless if they are multi mapping on the genome or uniquely mapping to that genome.
Since the reads mapping to multiple genomes are referred to for each individual genome the total percentages of reads mapping can be larger than a 100%. 

```{r fastqscreen_paragraph, echo=F, results='asis', fig.width=10, error=F, warning=F, message=F}
plot(DEhelper.fastqscreen())
     
```



## UCSC Genome Browser tracks ##

The browser tracks are generated using bamCoverage tool in [deepTools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) and they are normalized using the Counts Per Million mapped reads (CPM) method. Both unique and multi-mapped reads are included in the generation of browser coverage tracks.

To view the tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser, navigate to the [UCSC Genome Browser Track Hub page](https://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect) and enter the following line into the `URL` field:

```{r Trackhub, echo=F, results='asis', error=F, warning=F, message=F}
cat(DEhelper.Trackhub(), sep="\n")
```


## Library complexity assessment ##

Measuring the fraction of duplicated reads is commonly used to control for excessive PCR over-amplification during library preparation and/or for suboptimal amount of input material. However, in RNA-seq duplicated reads may also arise naturally due to the highly expressed (e.g. housekeeping) genes, which makes the overall read duplication rate useless. The IMB-developed tool dupRadar (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dupRadar.html) gives an informative insight into the duplication problem by graphically relating the gene expression levels and the observed duplication rates. Thus, problematic samples can be easily identified by visual inspection.

## Quality control of cells and RNA sequenced

To assess if the sequenced libraries are usable and the RNA captured represents a meaningful fraction of the RNA present in the cell, we are focussing on the following factors:

* **Library size:** for cells with small library size the RNA was not efficiently captured.
* **Number of expressed genes:** few expressed genes suggest that a diverse transcript population was not captured.
* **Proportion of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes:** high proportion mean increased apoptosis and/or loss of cytoplasmatic RNA from lysed cells.

To remove outliers, these criteria may be filtered either for relative thresholds using the median absolute deviation (MAD) or by setting absolute threshold after inspecting the quality control plots.

## Top most highly expressed genes

The plot below shows the most highly expressed genes (based on un-normalized mean counts). This should generally be dominated by constitutively expressed transcripts, such as those for ribosomal or mitochondrial proteins. All mitochondrial genes are marked as "Feature control". The color represents the total number of expressed genes in the respective sample/cell.

rm(tmp.sce)
```


## Filtering out low abundance genes

Average counts per gene should correlate with number of cells expressing it (see plot below). 
Low abundance genes are likely to be dominated by drop-out events (Poisson noise in different cells). They do not contain enough information for statistical inference, and may compromise accuracy of continuous approximations when fitting the data (edgeR biological coefficient of variation (BCV) estimation). Here, we filter out genes with no expression in 95% of the cells.

```{r remove_low_abundance_genes, results='asis'}
rowData(sce)$ave.count <- calculateAverage(sce) 
expressed.cells <- nexprs(sce, byrow=TRUE)   # number of cells expressing the gene
smoothScatter(log10(rowData(sce)$ave.count), expressed.cells,
              xlab=expression("Log10 average count"), ylab= "Number of expressing cells")
# is.ercc <- isSpike(sce, type="ERCC")
# points(log10(ave.counts[is.ercc]), numcells[is.ercc], col="red", pch=16, cex=0.5)

# filtering for low abundance genes

# Normalization of cell-specific biases
Normalization is required to eliminate these cell-specific differences in capture efficiency, prior to downstream quantitative analyses.

## Normalization for library size

Size factors can be calculated with DESeq2 or edgeR, but these methods do not work well with single-cell data due to the dominance of low and zero counts. To overcome this, we use the method from Lun et al. (2016) implemented in the *cran* package, which pools counts from many cells to estimate the size factors and to finally deconvolute them to cell-specific factors. Finally, normalized log2-expression values are computed for each endogenous gene using the appropriate size factors.

## Checking for confounding factors 

### Classification and normalization of cell cycle phase

We use the prediction method described by Scialdone et al. (2015) to classify cells into cell cycle phases based on the gene expression data. Pre-trained classifiers are available in scran for human and mouse data. Cells are classified as being in G1 phase if the G1 score is above 0.5 and greater than the G2/M score, in G2/M phase if the G2/M score is above 0.5 and greater than the G1 score, and in S phase if neither score is above 0.5.

Remark for adjustment: in routine scRNA-seq analyses it is not recommended to adjust for cell cycle. Compared to other differences between cell types it is a minor factor of variation and any attempt at removal would also need to assume that the cell cycle effect is orthogonal to other biological processes. For example, regression would potentially remove interesting signal if cell cycle activity varied across clusters or conditions. Cell cycle adjustment may be performed on an as-needed basis in populations with clear cell cycle effects.

### Identify explanatory variables 

We check whether there are technical factors that contribute substantially to the heterogeneity of gene expression. If so, the factor may need to be regressed out to ensure that it does not inflate the variances or introduce spurious correlations.

# (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/batchelor/inst/doc/correction.html#3_mutual_nearest_neighbors)
# correctExperiments() # Apply a correction to multiple SingleCellExperiment objects, while also combining the 
# assay data and column metadata for easy use. batchCorrect does the correction inside this function
# batchCorrect() # A common interface for single-cell batch correction methods
# fastMNN() # For scRNA-seq data, fastMNN() tends to be both faster and better at achieving a satisfactory merge than mnnCorrect()
# mnnCorrect() # The original method described by Haghverdi et al. (2018), is mainly provided here for posterity’s sake
#     The MNN-corrected values can be used for further correction with mnnCorrect().
#     This is useful in nested experimental designs involving multiple batches within each of multiple studies. 
#     Users should set cos.norm.in=FALSE and cos.norm.out=FALSE when supplying mnnCorrect() with MNN-corrected values. 
#     This ensures that the cosine normalization is only applied once, during the first round of MNN correction.
#     (https://bioc.ism.ac.jp/packages/3.7/workflows/vignettes/simpleSingleCell/inst/doc/work-5-mnn.html).
#     MNN-corrected values are generally not suitable for differential expression (DE) analyses.
# rescaleBatches() # conceptually equivalent to running removeBatchEffect() from limma with no covariates other than the batch. 
#     While this method is fast and simple, it makes the strong assumption that the population composition of each batch is the same. 
#     This is usually not the case for scRNA-seq experiments in real systems that exhibit biological variation. 
#     Thus, rescaleBatches() is best suited for merging technical replicates of the same sample, e.g., that have 
#     been sequenced separately.
# regressBatches() # Alternative to rescaleBatches(), a more direct linear regression of the batch effect. 
#     This does not preserve sparsity but uses a different set of tricks to avoid explicitly creating a dense matrix, 
#     specifically by using the ResidualMatrix class from the BiocSingular package.
# multiBatchNorm() # Differences in sequencing depth between batches are an obvious cause for batch-to-batch differences. 
#     These can be removed by multiBatchNorm(), which downscales all batches to match the coverage of the least-sequenced batch.

# Identifying highly variable genes (HVGs)

The per-gene variation is quantified by computing the variance of the log-normalized expression values for each gene across all cells in the population (A. T. L. Lun, McCarthy, and Marioni 2016). This has an advantage in that the feature selection is based on the same log-values that are used for later downstream steps. In particular, genes with the largest variances in log-values will contribute the most to the Euclidean distances between cells. By using log-values here, we ensure that our quantitative definition of heterogeneity is consistent throughout the entire analysis.

Calculation of the per-gene variance is simple but feature selection requires modelling of the mean-variance relationship. The log-transformation does not achieve perfect variance stabilization, which means that the variance of a gene is driven more by its abundance than its underlying biological heterogeneity. To account for this effect, we use the modelGeneVar() function to fit a trend to the variance with respect to abundance across all genes (see scatter plot below).

```{r trendVar, echo=F, error=F, warning=F, message=F}
# estimate highly variable genes
decVar <- modelGeneVar(sce)
var.fit <- metadata(decVar)

plot(var.fit$mean, var.fit$var, xlab="Mean of log-expression",
    ylab="Variance of log-expression")
curve(var.fit$trend(x), col="dodgerblue", add=TRUE, lwd=2)
```


At any given abundance, we assume that the expression profiles of most genes are dominated by random technical noise. Under this assumption, our trend represents an estimate of the technical noise as a function of abundance. We then break down the total variance of each gene into the technical component, i.e., the fitted value of the trend at that gene’s abundance; and the biological component, defined as the difference between the total variance and the technical component. This biological component represents the “interesting” variation for each gene and can be used as the metric for HVG selection.

Once we have quantified the per-gene variation, the next step is to select the subset of HVGs to use in downstream analyses. A larger subset will reduce the risk of discarding interesting biological signal by retaining more potentially relevant genes, at the cost of increasing noise from irrelevant genes that might obscure said signal. Here, we consider the top 10% of genes with the highest biological components as HVGs for downstream analysis.

```{r get_hvg, results='asis', fig.width=11, echo=F, error=F, warning=F, message=F}
annoFactors <- colorByFactor2

# Ordering by most interesting genes for inspection.
decVar_ordered <- decVar[order(decVar$bio, decreasing=TRUE),]

## Identification of sub-populations with t-SNE 

Another widely used approach is the t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) method (Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008). t-SNE  tends  to  work  better  than  PCA  for  separating  cells  in  more  diverse  populations.  This  is  because  the former can directly capture non-linear relationships in high-dimensional space, whereas the latter must represent them (suboptimally) as linear components. However, this improvement comes at the cost of more computational effort and complexity. In particular, t-SNE is a stochastic method, so users should run the algorithm several times to ensure that the results are representative, and then set a seed to ensure that the chosen results are reproducible. It is also advisable to test different settings of the “perplexity” parameter as this will affect the distribution of points in the low-dimensional space.

The perplexity can be interpreted as a smooth measure of the effective number of neighbors. The performance of SNE is fairly robust to changes in the perplexity, and typical values are between 5 and 50. 

A major weakness of t-SNE is that the cost function is not convex, as a result of which several optimization parameters need to be chosen. The constructed solutions depend on these choices of optimization parameters and may be different each time t-SNE is run from an initial random configuration of map points. But the developers of t-SNE have demonstrated that the same choice of optimization parameters can be used for a variety of different visualization tasks and found that the quality of the optima does not vary much from run to run. Thus, t-SNE should not be rejected in favor of methods that lead to convex optimization problems but produce noticeably worse visualizations. A local optimum of a cost function that accurately captures what is wanted in a visualization is often preferable to the global optimum of a cost function that fails to capture important aspects of what is wanted.

# Clustering

## Defining clusters with SC3

Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3) is a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Genes used for clustering are filtered based on gene dropout rates of the counts matrix. SC3 recommends a number of clusters to be used for clustering.

## Graph-based clustering with igraph

Graph-based clustering is a flexible and scalable technique for clustering large scRNA-seq datasets. We first build a graph where each node is a cell that is connected to its nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional space. Edges are weighted based on the similarity between the cells involved, with higher weight given to cells that are more closely related. We then apply algorithms to identify communities of cells that are more connected to cells in the same community than they are to cells of different communities. Each community represents a cluster that we can use for downstream interpretation. 

Graph construction avoids making strong assumptions about the shape of the clusters or the distribution of cells within each cluster, compared to other methods. k is the number of nearest neighbors used to construct the graph. This controls the resolution of the clustering where higher k yields a more inter-connected graph and broader clusters. Users can exploit this by experimenting with different values of k to obtain a satisfactory resolution.

Clustering is applied on the respective dimension reduction slot (i.e. PCA, TSNE or UMAP).

## Hierarchical clustering

Hierarchical clustering aims to generate a dendrogram containing a hierarchy of samples. This is most commonly done by greedily agglomerating samples into clusters, then agglomerating those clusters into larger clusters, and so on until all samples belong to a single cluster. Variants of hierarchical clustering methods primarily differ in how they choose to perform the agglomerations.

The dendrogram describes the relationships between cells and subpopulations at various resolutions and in a quantitative manner based on the branch lengths. Users can cut the tree at different heights to define clusters with different granularity, where clusters defined at high resolution are guaranteed to be nested within those defined at a lower resolution. The dendrogram is also a natural representation of the data in situations where cells have descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. For larger datasets hierarchical clustering may be too slow.

Clustering is applied on the respective dimension reduction slot (i.e. PCA, TSNE or UMAP).

In some cases, only a subset of the cells in the putative doublet cluster actually have high scores, and removing these would still leave enough cells in that cluster to mislead downstream analyses. In fact, even defining a threshold on the doublet score is difficult as the interpretation of the score is relative. There is no general definition for a fixed threshold above which libraries are to be considered doublets.

# We recommend interpreting the computeDoubletDensity() scores in the context of cluster annotation. All cells from a cluster with a large average doublet score should be considered suspect, and close neighbors of problematic clusters should also be treated with caution.

# Detect marker genes for each cluster

Next we identify the genes that drive separation between clusters of the final clustering setting. These marker genes allow us to assign biological meaning to each cluster based on their functional annotation. In the most obvious case, the marker genes for each cluster are a priori associated with particular cell types, allowing us to treat the clustering as a proxy for cell type identity. We use a one-sided t-test to identify genes that are upregulated in each cluster compared to the others (test for log foldchange > 1).

Additionally, we use a cluster specific approach. Instead of identifying genes upregulated compared to any of the other clusters, we only consider genes that are up-regulated in all pairwise comparisons involving the cluster of interest. To achieve this, we use an intersection-union test where the combined p-value for each gene is the maximum of the p-values from all pairwise comparisons (apply setting pval.type="all"). A gene will only achieve a low combined p-value if it is strongly DE in all comparisons to other clusters.

For each cluster, every gene is assigned with the highest rank which from comparisons with all other clusters. E.g. the set of genes with top rank <= n contains the top n genes from each comparison. These genes which distinguish that cluster from any other cluster are visualized in a heatmap across all clusters.

cat("# Multi-sample comparisons

Differential analyses of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq experiments can be broadly split into two categories: differential expression (DE) and differential abundance (DA) analyses. The former tests for changes in expression between conditions for cells of the same type that are present in both conditions, while the latter tests for changes in the composition of cell types (or states, etc.) between conditions.

## Differential expression between conditions using pseudo-bulk samples

Motivations behind the use of pseudo-bulking:

- Larger counts are more amenable to standard DE analysis pipelines designed for bulk RNA-seq data. Normalization is more straightforward and certain statistical approximations are more accurate for large counts.
- Collapsing cells into samples reflects the fact that our biological replication occurs at the sample level (Lun and Marioni 2017). Each sample is represented no more than once for each condition, avoiding problems from unmodelled correlations between samples. Supplying the per-cell counts directly to a DE analysis pipeline would imply that each cell is an independent biological replicate, which is not true from an experimental perspective. 
- Variance between cells within each sample is masked, provided it does not affect variance across (replicate) samples. This avoids penalizing DEGs that are not uniformly up- or down-regulated for all cells in all samples of one condition. Masking is generally desirable as DEGs - unlike marker genes - do not need to have low within-sample variance to be interesting, e.g., if the treatment effect is consistent across replicate populations but heterogeneous on a per-cell basis. 
    
The DE analysis will be performed using quasi-likelihood (QL) methods from the edgeR package (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010; Chen, Lun, and Smyth 2016). This uses a negative binomial generalized linear model (NB GLM) to handle overdispersed count data in experiments with limited replication. We test for differences in expression using glmQLFTest(). DEGs are defined as those with non-zero log-fold changes at a false discovery rate of 5%.
